		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<h2>I'm Dylan and I hate web development.</h2>
		<p>
			This site is to showcase my talents in a skill that I hate to use. I am doing this so that I can get a job and put food on the table.
		 	If you're reading this, perhaps you'll consder helping out with that.
		</p>
		<h3>Maybe web development is a dying art</h3>
		<p>The printing press. The steam engine. The telegram. All inventions that revolutionized society and changed the world forever. Now it's happening again
			and I am frankly terrified. AI is dual use technology. It can help and it can harm. Today, we can stand up a site with a short prompt so why pay someone to do it?
			How relevant are my extremely crude web development skills these days?
